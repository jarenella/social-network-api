# Installation

If you would like to use this as a sort of starting template for your own project, clone it into your own repo and make sure to install related NPM dependencies. You will also have to run the seed script which can be found in package.json to seed mongoDB. This should only really be necessary if you would like to use the starting seeds before starting the server. You can also add your own seeds or expand upon the ones here by going into the seeds file where you can edit the seed.js folder. I would recommend this if you want to test the API with more data, as the included seeds are relatively minimal.

# Usage Information

Databases should be seeded with the command 'npm run seed'. However, this may change in future versions and may be done automatically when starting the server if the database is empty. When the server is running, making requests through the specified routes should alter and display information in the database.

# Contribution guidelines

This project is open to all contributions.

# Test instructions

Built in jest tests may be included in future versions.
